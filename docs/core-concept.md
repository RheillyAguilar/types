# Core Concepts of @stackpress/types

This document outlines the core concepts and key types provided by the @stackpress/types library. Understanding these concepts will help you effectively use the library in your TypeScript projects.

## 1. Nested Structures

### Nest and ReadonlyNest

The `Nest` and `ReadonlyNest` types are fundamental to creating type-safe nested object structures.

- `Nest<T>`: Allows for creating mutable nested objects with a consistent type `T` at any level of nesting.
- `ReadonlyNest<T>`: Similar to `Nest`, but creates immutable nested structures, preventing modifications after initialization.

These types are particularly useful for configuration objects, complex data structures, and scenarios where you need to enforce type consistency across nested levels.

## 2. Event Handling

### EventEmitter

The `EventEmitter` class implements the observer pattern, providing a robust way to handle events in your application.

Key features:
- Emit custom events with typed payloads
- Register event listeners with type-safe callbacks
- Remove listeners when they're no longer needed

This is particularly useful for building loosely coupled systems and implementing pub/sub patterns in your TypeScript applications.

## 3. Status Representation

### Status Enum

The `Status` enum provides a standardized way to represent the state of operations or processes in your application.

Common statuses include:
- `Success`: Indicates a successful operation
- `Failure`: Indicates a failed operation
- `Pending`: Represents an operation in progress

Using the `Status` enum helps in creating consistent status reporting across your application and can be easily extended for more specific status types.

## 4. Exception Handling

### Exception Class

The `Exception` class extends the built-in `Error` class to provide more structured and informative error handling.

Key features:
- Custom error codes
- Additional metadata for debugging
- Consistent error formatting

This allows for more detailed error reporting and easier debugging in complex applications.

## 5. Reflection Utilities

### Reflection

The `Reflection` utilities provide methods for runtime type checking and manipulation.

Key features:
- Type checking functions (e.g., `isString`, `isNumber`)
- Type conversion utilities
- Property reflection for objects

These utilities are particularly useful when working with dynamic data or implementing generic functions that need to handle multiple types.
